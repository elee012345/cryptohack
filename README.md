# cryptohack
I can't use private repos with gitkraken (i always break things with git cli) and as per
cyptohack's rules you are not supposed to publish answers so people can't cheat.
Don't cheat pls cheating is very very bad don't do it
if i figured all of this out so can you

I am keeping this on github so that I can use this as reference and also so that I don't accidentally
delete this (it's happened before)
